// Given a sorted array arr[] and a number target, the task is to find the upper bound of the target in this given array.
// The upper bound of a number is defined as the smallest index in the sorted array where the element is greater than the given number.

// Note: If all the elements in the given array are smaller than or equal to the target, the upper bound will be the length of the array.

// Examples :

// Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 11, 25], target = 9
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 3 is the smallest index in arr[], at which element (arr[3] = 10) is larger than 9.
